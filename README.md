###Scope
The goal was to create an app that uses the Flickr API to retrieve photos based on a tag. 
It gets 100 images and plots them on a map based on their coordinates. 
Users can search for other tags to get back a different collection of images. 

Out of scope features (may be added on future releases) include:
* Search for images based on user location
